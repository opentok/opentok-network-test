### Opening an Issue - Bug Reports or Feature Requests

We always welcome feedback, if you've seen something that isn't quite right or you have a suggestion for a new feature, please go ahead and open an issue in this project. Select the appropriate template and include as much information as you have, it really helps.

### Making a Code Change

We're always open to pull requests, but these should be small and clearly described so that we can understand what you're trying to do. Feel free to open an issue first and get some discussion going.

When you're ready to start coding, fork this repository to your own GitHub account and make your changes in a new branch based on develop. Once you're happy, open a pull request to merge into develop and explain what the change is and why you think we should include it in our project.

All the commits pushed into *develop* and *master* branches have to be signed. Please refer to [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits). Commits that are not signed can't be merged into *develop* or *master* branches.

### Branching 

Our *master* branch is the evergreen source of truth for the Vonage Video API Reference App for React. However, all new development should be done in the develop branch. Contributions should be made by branching off develop, and pull requests should be submitted against develop. Periodically, develop will be merged into master as a batch.
 
Internally, we use Jira for issue tracking. Issue and feature branches use the format DEVELOPERNAME/TICKETNUMBER-SHORTDESCRIPTION e.g. alicesmith/VIDCS-123-fix-broken-icon. If you'd like to contribute a pull request, please use a branch on your fork with a descriptive name e.g. **fix-broken-icon**.

Release versions use the format v-RELEASENUMBER number, e.g. v1.0.0. We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for our releases.
